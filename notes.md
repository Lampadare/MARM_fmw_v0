TODO:

- Implement FIFO queue with faketada module
- Implement SD card write

Potentially:

- potentially neural network to fill in the gaps where there might be missing packets

Done:

- implement logic to renegotiate comms terms at the beginning to go for low latency (look at devacademy)
- understand setting up constant connection with regular data windows, why is it not like that already?
- do we need notifications for this to be the case?
